    Data Science in the Enterprise
    
    Introduction
    Data science is the practice of extracting meaningful insights from data using 
    statistics, mathematics, and programming. In enterprise settings, data science 
    drives strategic decision-making and creates competitive advantages.
    
    Data Collection and Preparation
    The foundation of any data science project is quality data. Data scientists spend 
    significant time collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. This includes:
    - Data validation
    - Missing value handling
    - Outlier detection
    - Feature engineering
    
    Exploratory Data Analysis
    EDA helps understand data distribution, relationships, and patterns. Visualization 
    tools like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly are essential for EDA.
    
    Model Development
    Building predictive models involves:
    - Algorithm selection
    - Training and validation
    - Hyperparameter tuning
    - Cross-validation
    
    Deployment and Monitoring
    Once a model is ready, it must be deployed into production. This requires:
    - API development
    - Containerization (Docker)
    - Orchestration (Kubernetes)
    - Performance monitoring
    
    Tools and Technologies
    Popular tools in data science include:
    - Python and R for programming
    - TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning
    - Scikit-learn for classical ML
    - Apache Spark for big data processing
